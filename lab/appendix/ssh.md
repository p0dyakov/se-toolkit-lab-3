## `SSH` and shells

`Secure Shell` (`SSH`) is a protocol used to securely connect to remote servers.

You can use it to connect to [your virtual machine](./vm.md#your-vm).

## SSH daemon

## `ssh-agent`

## Set up SSH

Steps:

<!-- no toc -->
1. [Check your current shell](./vs-code.md#check-the-current-shell-in-the-vs-code-terminal).
2. [Create a new `SSH` key](#create-a-new-ssh-key)
3. [Find the `SSH` key files](#find-the-ssh-key-files)
4. [Add the host to the `SSH` config](#add-the-host-to-the-ssh-config)
5. [Start the `ssh-agent`](#start-the-ssh-agent)

### Create a new `SSH` key

Generate a key pair: a **private key** (secret) and a **public key** (safe to share).

We'll use the `ed25519` algorithm, which is the modern standard for security and performance.

Steps:

1. [Run using the `VS Code Terminal`](./vs-code.md#run-a-command-using-the-vs-code-terminal):

   ```terminal
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "se-toolkit-student" -f ~/.ssh/se_toolkit_key
   ```

   *Note:* You can replace `"se-toolkit-student"` with your email or another label.

   *Note:* `-f ~/.ssh/se_toolkit_key` sets a custom file path and name.

2. **Passphrase:** When asked `Enter passphrase`, you may type a secure password or press `Enter` for no passphrase.
  
   *Note:* If you set a passphrase, use `ssh-agent` to avoid retyping it on every connection.

### Find the `SSH` key files

`SSH` keys are generated in pairs. You must know which file is which.

Because you used a custom name, your keys are named `se_toolkit_key` (private) and `se_toolkit_key.pub` (public).

1. Verify they were created:

   [Run using the `VS Code Terminal`](./vs-code.md#run-a-command-using-the-vs-code-terminal):

   ```terminal
   ls ~/.ssh/se_toolkit_key*
   ```

2. You should see two files listed.

   The file ending in `.pub` contains the public key.

   Another file contains the private key.

3. View the content of the public key file:

   [Run using the `VS Code Terminal`](./vs-code.md#run-a-command-using-the-vs-code-terminal):

   ```terminal
   cat ~/.ssh/se_toolkit_key.pub
   ```

   You should see something similar to this:

   ```terminal
   ssh-ed25519 AKdk38D3faWJnlFfalFJSKEFGG/vmLQ62Z+vpWCe5e/c2n37cnNc39N3c8qb7cBS+e3d se-toolkit-student
   ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Never share the private key.
> This is your secret identity.

### Add the host to the `SSH` config

1. [Open the file](./vs-code.md#open-the-file):
   `~/.ssh/config`

2. Add this text at the end of the file.

   ```text

   Host se-toolkit-vm
      HostName <your-vm-ip-address>
      User root
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/se_toolkit_key
      AddKeysToAgent yes
      UseKeychain yes
   ```

3. Replace `<your-vm-ip-address>` with the [IP address of your VM](./vm.md#get-the-ip-address-of-the-vm).

### Start the `ssh-agent`

1. [Run using the `VS Code Terminal`](./vs-code.md#run-a-command-using-the-vs-code-terminal):

   ```terminal
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/se_toolkit_key
   ```

`Windows PowerShell`:

1. Run:

   ```powershell
   Get-Service ssh-agent | Set-Service -StartupType Automatic
   Start-Service ssh-agent
   ssh-add $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\se_toolkit_key
   ```

### Verify the `SSH` setup

1. [Open a new `VS Code Terminal`](./vs-code.md#open-a-new-vs-code-terminal).
2. [Check the current shell in the `VS Code Terminal`](./vs-code.md#).
3. [Run using the `VS Code Terminal`](../appendix/vs-code.md#run-a-command-using-the-vs-code-terminal):

   ```terminal
   ssh-add -l
   ```

4. You should see your key fingerprint in the output.

5. If you see `The agent has no identities`, run the [start `ssh-agent` step](#start-the-ssh-agent) again.

## Connect to the VM

You can connect using the alias that you [added to your `SSH` config](#add-the-host-to-the-ssh-config).

1. [Run using the `VS Code Terminal`](./vs-code.md#run-a-command-using-the-vs-code-terminal):

   ```terminal
   ssh se-toolkit-vm
   ```

2. If this is your first time connecting:
   1. You will see a message:
      `The authenticity of host ... can't be established.`

3. Type `yes` and press `Enter`.
4. After successful login, you should see a shell prompt on the remote machine.

## Common errors

### `Permission denied (publickey)`

1. Check `IdentityFile` in `~/.ssh/config`.
2. Ensure the public key was added to the remote host.
3. Ensure your key is loaded: `ssh-add -l`.

### `Bad owner or permissions`

1. [Run using the `VS Code Terminal`](./vs-code.md#run-a-command-using-the-vs-code-terminal):

   ```terminal
   chmod 700 ~/.ssh
   chmod 600 ~/.ssh/se_toolkit_key
   chmod 644 ~/.ssh/se_toolkit_key.pub
   ```

### `Connection timed out`

1. Verify host IP and network connectivity.
2. Verify the VM is running.
3. Use verbose logs to debug:

   ```terminal
   ssh -v se-toolkit-vm
   ```
